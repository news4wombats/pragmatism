# I. THE GREAT MYSTERY


> Solitary Worship. The Savage Philosopher. The Dual Mind.
> Spiritual Gifts versus Material Progress. The Paradox of
> "Christian Civilization."

The original attitude of the American Indian toward the Eternal, the
"Great Mystery" that surrounds and embraces us, was as simple as it
was exalted. To him it was the supreme conception, bringing with it the
fullest measure of joy and satisfaction possible in this life.

The worship of the "Great Mystery" was silent, solitary, free from all
self-seeking. It was silent, because all speech is of necessity feeble
and imperfect; therefore the souls of my ancestors ascended to God in
wordless adoration. It was solitary, because they believed that He is
nearer to us in solitude, and there were no priests authorized to come
between a man and his Maker. None might exhort or confess or in any way
meddle with the religious experience of another. Among us all men were
created sons of God and stood erect, as conscious of their divinity. Our
faith might not be formulated in creeds, nor forced upon any who were
unwilling to receive it; hence there was no preaching, proselyting, nor
persecution, neither were there any scoffers or atheists.

There were no temples or shrines among us save those of nature. Being
a natural man, the Indian was intensely poetical. He would deem it
sacrilege to build a house for Him who may be met face to face in the
mysterious, shadowy aisles of the primeval forest, or on the sunlit
bosom of virgin prairies, upon dizzy spires and pinnacles of naked rock,
and yonder in the jeweled vault of the night sky! He who enrobes Himself
in filmy veils of cloud, there on the rim of the visible world where our
Great-Grandfather Sun kindles his evening camp-fire, He who rides
upon the rigorous wind of the north, or breathes forth His spirit upon
aromatic southern airs, whose war-canoe is launched upon majestic rivers
and inland seas--He needs no lesser cathedral!

That solitary communion with the Unseen which was the highest expression
of our religious life is partly described in the word bambeday,
literally "mysterious feeling," which has been variously translated
"fasting" and "dreaming." It may better be interpreted as "consciousness
of the divine."

The first bambeday, or religious retreat, marked an epoch in the life of
the youth, which may be compared to that of confirmation or conversion
in Christian experience. Having first prepared himself by means of
the purifying vapor-bath, and cast off as far as possible all human or
fleshly influences, the young man sought out the noblest height, the
most commanding summit in all the surrounding region. Knowing that God
sets no value upon material things, he took with him no offerings or
sacrifices other than symbolic objects, such as paints and tobacco.
Wishing to appear before Him in all humility, he wore no clothing save
his moccasins and breech-clout. At the solemn hour of sunrise or sunset
he took up his position, overlooking the glories of earth and facing
the "Great Mystery," and there he remained, naked, erect, silent, and
motionless, exposed to the elements and forces of His arming, for a
night and a day to two days and nights, but rarely longer. Sometimes he
would chant a hymn without words, or offer the ceremonial "filled pipe."
In this holy trance or ecstasy the Indian mystic found his highest
happiness and the motive power of his existence.

When he returned to the camp, he must remain at a distance until he had
again entered the vapor-bath and prepared himself for intercourse with
his fellows. Of the vision or sign vouchsafed to him he did not speak,
unless it had included some commission which must be publicly fulfilled.
Sometimes an old man, standing upon the brink of eternity, might reveal
to a chosen few the oracle of his long-past youth.

The native American has been generally despised by his white conquerors
for his poverty and simplicity. They forget, perhaps, that his religion
forbade the accumulation of wealth and the enjoyment of luxury. To him,
as to other single-minded men in every age and race, from Diogenes to
the brothers of Saint Francis, from the Montanists to the Shakers, the
love of possessions has appeared a snare, and the burdens of a complex
society a source of needless peril and temptation. Furthermore, it was
the rule of his life to share the fruits of his skill and success with
his less fortunate brothers. Thus he kept his spirit free from the clog
of pride, cupidity, or envy, and carried out, as he believed, the divine
decree--a matter profoundly important to him.

It was not, then, wholly from ignorance or improvidence that he failed
to establish permanent towns and to develop a material civilization.
To the untutored sage, the concentration of population was the prolific
mother of all evils, moral no less than physical. He argued that food is
good, while surfeit kills; that love is good, but lust destroys; and not
less dreaded than the pestilence following upon crowded and unsanitary
dwellings was the loss of spiritual power inseparable from too close
contact with one's fellow-men. All who have lived much out of doors know
that there is a magnetic and nervous force that accumulates in solitude
and that is quickly dissipated by life in a crowd; and even his enemies
have recognized the fact that for a certain innate power and self-poise,
wholly independent of circumstances, the American Indian is unsurpassed
among men.

The red man divided mind into two parts,--the spiritual mind and the
physical mind. The first is pure spirit, concerned only with the essence
of things, and it was this he sought to strengthen by spiritual prayer,
during which the body is subdued by fasting and hardship. In this type
of prayer there was no beseeching of favor or help. All matters of
personal or selfish concern, as success in hunting or warfare, relief
from sickness, or the sparing of a beloved life, were definitely
relegated to the plane of the lower or material mind, and all
ceremonies, charms, or incantations designed to secure a benefit or to
avert a danger, were recognized as emanating from the physical self.

The rites of this physical worship, again, were wholly symbolic, and the
Indian no more worshiped the Sun than the Christian adores the Cross.
The Sun and the Earth, by an obvious parable, holding scarcely more of
poetic metaphor than of scientific truth, were in his view the parents
of all organic life. From the Sun, as the universal father, proceeds the
quickening principle in nature, and in the patient and fruitful womb of
our mother, the Earth, are hidden embryos of plants and men. Therefore
our reverence and love for them was really an imaginative extension of
our love for our immediate parents, and with this sentiment of filial
piety was joined a willingness to appeal to them, as to a father, for
such good gifts as we may desire. This is the material or physical
prayer.

The elements and majestic forces in nature, Lightning, Wind, Water,
Fire, and Frost, were regarded with awe as spiritual powers, but always
secondary and intermediate in character. We believed that the spirit
pervades all creation and that every creature possesses a soul in some
degree, though not necessarily a soul conscious of itself. The tree, the
waterfall, the grizzly bear, each is an embodied Force, and as such an
object of reverence.

The Indian loved to come into sympathy and spiritual communion with his
brothers of the animal kingdom, whose inarticulate souls had for him
something of the sinless purity that we attribute to the innocent and
irresponsible child. He had faith in their instincts, as in a mysterious
wisdom given from above; and while he humbly accepted the supposedly
voluntary sacrifice of their bodies to preserve his own, he paid homage
to their spirits in prescribed prayers and offerings.

In every religion there is an element of the supernatural, varying with
the influence of pure reason over its devotees. The Indian was a logical
and clear thinker upon matters within the scope of his understanding,
but he had not yet charted the vast field of nature or expressed her
wonders in terms of science. With his limited knowledge of cause and
effect, he saw miracles on every hand,--the miracle of life in seed and
egg, the miracle of death in lightning flash and in the swelling deep!
Nothing of the marvelous could astonish him; as that a beast should
speak, or the sun stand still. The virgin birth would appear scarcely
more miraculous than is the birth of every child that comes into the
world, or the miracle of the loaves and fishes excite more wonder than
the harvest that springs from a single ear of corn.

Who may condemn his superstition? Surely not the devout Catholic, or
even Protestant missionary, who teaches Bible miracles as literal fact!
The logical man must either deny all miracles or none, and our American
Indian myths and hero stories are perhaps, in themselves, quite as
credible as those of the Hebrews of old. If we are of the modern type
of mind, that sees in natural law a majesty and grandeur far more
impressive than any solitary infraction of it could possibly be, let
us not forget that, after all, science has not explained everything. We
have still to face the ultimate miracle,--the origin and principle
of life! Here is the supreme mystery that is the essence of worship,
without which there can be no religion, and in the presence of
this mystery our attitude cannot be very unlike that of the natural
philosopher, who beholds with awe the Divine in all creation.

It is simple truth that the Indian did not, so long as his native
philosophy held sway over his mind, either envy or desire to imitate
the splendid achievements of the white man. In his own thought he rose
superior to them! He scorned them, even as a lofty spirit absorbed
in its stern task rejects the soft beds, the luxurious food, the
pleasure-worshiping dalliance of a rich neighbor. It was clear to
him that virtue and happiness are independent of these things, if not
incompatible with them.

There was undoubtedly much in primitive Christianity to appeal to this
man, and Jesus' hard sayings to the rich and about the rich would have
been entirely comprehensible to him. Yet the religion that is preached
in our churches and practiced by our congregations, with its element of
display and self-aggrandizement, its active proselytism, and its open
contempt of all religions but its own, was for a long time extremely
repellent. To his simple mind, the professionalism of the pulpit, the
paid exhorter, the moneyed church, was an unspiritual and unedifying
thing, and it was not until his spirit was broken and his moral and
physical constitution undermined by trade, conquest, and strong drink,
that Christian missionaries obtained any real hold upon him. Strange as
it may seem, it is true that the proud pagan in his secret soul despised
the good men who came to convert and to enlighten him!

Nor were its publicity and its Phariseeism the only elements in the
alien religion that offended the red man. To him, it appeared shocking
and almost incredible that there were among this people who claimed
superiority many irreligious, who did not even pretend to profess the
national faith. Not only did they not profess it, but they stooped so
low as to insult their God with profane and sacrilegious speech! In our
own tongue His name was not spoken aloud, even with utmost reverence,
much less lightly or irreverently.

More than this, even in those white men who professed religion we found
much inconsistency of conduct. They spoke much of spiritual things,
while seeking only the material. They bought and sold everything:
time, labor, personal independence, the love of woman, and even the
ministrations of their holy faith! The lust for money, power, and
conquest so characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race did not escape moral
condemnation at the hands of his untutored judge, nor did he fail to
contrast this conspicuous trait of the dominant race with the spirit of
the meek and lowly Jesus.

He might in time come to recognize that the drunkards and licentious
among white men, with whom he too frequently came in contact, were
condemned by the white man's religion as well, and must not be held to
discredit it. But it was not so easy to overlook or to excuse national
bad faith. When distinguished emissaries from the Father at Washington,
some of them ministers of the gospel and even bishops, came to the
Indian nations, and pledged to them in solemn treaty the national honor,
with prayer and mention of their God; and when such treaties, so made,
were promptly and shamelessly broken, is it strange that the action
should arouse not only anger, but contempt? The historians of the white
race admit that the Indian was never the first to repudiate his oath.

It is my personal belief, after thirty-five years' experience of it,
that there is no such thing as "Christian civilization." I believe that
Christianity and modern civilization are opposed and irreconcilable,
and that the spirit of Christianity and of our ancient religion is
essentially the same.

# IV. BARBARISM AND THE MORAL CODE

> Silence the Corner-Stone of Character. Basic Ideas of
> Morality. "Give All or Nothing!" Rules of Honorable
> Warfare. An Indian Conception of Courage.

Long before I ever heard of Christ, or saw a white man, I had learned
from an untutored woman the essence of morality. With the help of dear
Nature herself, she taught me things simple but of mighty import. I
knew God. I perceived what goodness is. I saw and loved what is really
beautiful. Civilization has not taught me anything better!

As a child, I understood how to give; I have forgotten that grace since
I became civilized. I lived the natural life, whereas I now live the
artificial. Any pretty pebble was valuable to me then; every growing
tree an object of reverence. Now I worship with the white man before a
painted landscape whose value is estimated in dollars! Thus the Indian
is reconstructed, as the natural rocks are ground to powder, and made
into artificial blocks which may be built into the walls of modern
society.

The first American mingled with his pride a singular humility. Spiritual
arrogance was foreign to his nature and teaching. He never claimed that
the power of articulate speech was proof of superiority over the dumb
creation; on the other hand, it is to him a perilous gift. He believes
profoundly in silence--the sign of a perfect equilibrium. Silence is
the absolute poise or balance of body, mind, and spirit. The man
who preserves his selfhood ever calm and unshaken by the storms of
existence--not a leaf, as it were, astir on the tree; not a ripple upon
the surface of shining pool--his, in the mind of the unlettered sage, is
the ideal attitude and conduct of life.

If you ask him: "What is silence?" he will answer: "It is the Great
Mystery!" "The holy silence is His voice!" If you ask: "What are the
fruits of silence?" he will say: "They are self-control, true courage or
endurance, patience, dignity, and reverence. Silence is the cornerstone
of character."

"Guard your tongue in youth," said the old chief, Wabashaw, "and in age
you may mature a thought that will be of service to your people!"

The moment that man conceived of a perfect body, supple, symmetrical,
graceful, and enduring--in that moment he had laid the foundation of
a moral life! No man can hope to maintain such a temple of the spirit
beyond the period of adolescence, unless he is able to curb his
indulgence in the pleasures of the senses. Upon this truth the Indian
built a rigid system of physical training, a social and moral code that
was the law of his life.

There was aroused in him as a child a high ideal of manly strength and
beauty, the attainment of which must depend upon strict temperance in
eating and in the sexual relation, together with severe and persistent
exercise. He desired to be a worthy link in the generations, and that he
might not destroy by his weakness that vigor and purity of blood which
had been achieved at the cost of much self-denial by a long line of
ancestors.

He was required to fast from time to time for short periods, and to work
off his superfluous energy by means of hard running, swimming, and the
vapor-bath. The bodily fatigue thus induced, especially when coupled
with a reduced diet, is a reliable cure for undue sexual desires.

Personal modesty was early cultivated as a safeguard, together with a
strong self-respect and pride of family and race. This was accomplished
in part by keeping the child ever before the public eye, from his birth
onward. His entrance into the world, especially in the case of the
first-born, was often publicly announced by the herald, accompanied by
a distribution of presents to the old and needy. The same thing occurred
when he took his first step, when his ears were pierced, and when he
shot his first game, so that his childish exploits and progress were
known to the whole clan as to a larger family, and he grew into manhood
with the saving sense of a reputation to sustain.

The youth was encouraged to enlist early in the public service, and to
develop a wholesome ambition for the honors of a leader and feast-maker,
which can never be his unless he is truthful and generous, as well as
brave, and ever mindful of his personal chastity and honor. There were
many ceremonial customs which had a distinct moral influence; the woman
was rigidly secluded at certain periods, and the young husband was
forbidden to approach his own wife when preparing for war or for any
religious event. The public or tribal position of the Indian is entirely
dependent upon his private virtue, and he is never permitted to forget
that he does not live to himself alone, but to his tribe and his clan.
Thus habits of perfect self-control were early established, and there
were no unnatural conditions or complex temptations to beset him until
he was met and overthrown by a stronger race.

To keep the young men and young women strictly to their honor, there
were observed among us, within my own recollection, certain annual
ceremonies of a semi-religious nature. One of the most impressive of
these was the sacred "Feast of Virgins," which, when given for the
first time, was equivalent to the public announcement of a young girl's
arrival at a marriageable age. The herald, making the rounds of the
teepee village, would publish the feast something after this fashion:

"Pretty Weasel-woman, the daughter of Brave Bear, will kindle her first
maidens' fire to-morrow! All ye who have never yielded to the pleading
of man, who have not destroyed your innocency, you alone are invited, to
proclaim anew before the Sun and the Earth, before your companions
and in the sight of the Great Mystery, the chastity and purity of your
maidenhood. Come ye, all who have not known man!"

The whole village was at once aroused to the interest of the coming
event, which was considered next to the Sun Dance and the Grand Medicine
Dance in public importance. It always took place in midsummer, when
a number of different clans were gathered together for the summer
festivities, and was held in the centre of the great circular
encampment.

Here two circles were described, one within the other, about a rudely
heart-shaped rock which was touched with red paint, and upon either side
of the rock there were thrust into the ground a knife and two arrows.
The inner circle was for the maidens, and the outer one for their
grandmothers or chaperones, who were supposed to have passed the
climacteric. Upon the outskirts of the feast there was a great public
gathering, in which order was kept by certain warriors of highest
reputation. Any man among the spectators might approach and challenge
any young woman whom he knew to be unworthy; but if the accuser
failed to prove his charge, the warriors were accustomed to punish him
severely.

Each girl in turn approached the sacred rock and laid her hand upon it
with all solemnity. This was her religious declaration of her virginity,
her vow to remain pure until her marriage. If she should ever violate
the maidens' oath, then welcome that keen knife and those sharp arrows!

Our maidens were ambitious to attend a number of these feasts before
marriage, and it sometimes happened that a girl was compelled to give
one, on account of gossip about her conduct. Then it was in the nature
of a challenge to the scandal-mongers to prove their words! A similar
feast was sometimes made by the young men, for whom the rules were even
more strict, since no young man might attend this feast who had so much
as spoken of love to a maiden. It was considered a high honor among us
to have won some distinction in war and the chase, and above all to have
been invited to a seat in the council, before one had spoken to any girl
save his own sister.

It was our belief that the love of possessions is a weakness to be
overcome. Its appeal is to the material part, and if allowed its way
it will in time disturb the spiritual balance of the man. Therefore the
child must early learn the beauty of generosity. He is taught to give
what he prizes most, and that he may taste the happiness of giving, he
is made at an early age the family almoner. If a child is inclined to
be grasping, or to cling to any of his little possessions, legends are
related to him, telling of the contempt and disgrace falling upon the
ungenerous and mean man.

Public giving is a part of every important ceremony. It properly belongs
to the celebration of birth, marriage, and death, and is observed
whenever it is desired to do special honor to any person or event.
Upon such occasions it is common to give to the point of utter
impoverishment. The Indian in his simplicity literally gives away all
that he has, to relatives, to guests of another tribe or clan, but
above all to the poor and the aged, from whom he can hope for no return.
Finally, the gift to the "Great Mystery," the religious offering, may
be of little value in itself, but to the giver's own thought it should
carry the meaning and reward of true sacrifice.

Orphans and the aged are invariably cared for, not only by their next of
kin, but by the whole clan. It is the loving parent's pride to have his
daughters visit the unfortunate and the helpless, carry them food, comb
their hair, and mend their garments. The name "Wenonah," bestowed upon
the eldest daughter, distinctly implies all this, and a girl who failed
in her charitable duties was held to be unworthy of the name.

The man who is a skillful hunter, and whose wife is alive to her
opportunities, makes many feasts, to which he is careful to invite the
older men of his clan, recognizing that they have outlived their period
of greatest activity, and now love nothing so well as to eat in good
company, and to live over the past. The old men, for their part, do
their best to requite his liberality with a little speech, in which
they are apt to relate the brave and generous deeds of their host's
ancestors, finally congratulating him upon being a worthy successor
of an honorable line. Thus his reputation is won as a hunter and a
feast-maker, and almost as famous in his way as the great warrior is he
who has a recognized name and standing as a "man of peace."

The true Indian sets no price upon either his property or his labor. His
generosity is only limited by his strength and ability. He regards it as
an honor to be selected for a difficult or dangerous service, and would
think it shame to ask for any reward, saying rather: "Let him whom I
serve express his thanks according to his own bringing up and his sense
of honor!"

Nevertheless, he recognizes rights in property. To steal from one of
his own tribe would be indeed disgrace, and if discovered, the name of
"Wamanon," or Thief, is fixed upon him forever as an unalterable stigma.
The only exception to the rule is in the case of food, which is always
free to the hungry if there is none by to offer it. Other protection
than the moral law there could not be in an Indian community, where
there were neither locks nor doors, and everything was open and easy of
access to all comers.

The property of the enemy is spoil of war, and it is always allowable to
confiscate it if possible. However, in the old days there was not much
plunder. Before the coming of the white man, there was in fact little
temptation or opportunity to despoil the enemy; but in modern times the
practice of "stealing horses" from hostile tribes has become common, and
is thought far from dishonorable.

Warfare we regarded as an institution of the "Great Mystery"--an
organized tournament or trial of courage and skill, with elaborate rules
and "counts" for the coveted honor of the eagle feather. It was held
to develop the quality of manliness and its motive was chivalric or
patriotic, but never the desire for territorial aggrandizement or the
overthrow of a brother nation. It was common, in early times, for a
battle or skirmish to last all day, with great display of daring and
horsemanship, but with scarcely more killed and wounded than may be
carried from the field during a university game of football.

The slayer of a man in battle was expected to mourn for thirty days
blackening his face and loosening his hair according to the custom. He
of course considered it no sin to take the life of an enemy, and this
ceremonial mourning was a sign of reverence for the departed spirit. The
killing in war of non-combatants, such as women and children, is partly
explained by the fact that in savage life the woman without husband or
protector is in pitiable case, and it was supposed that the spirit of
the warrior would be better content if no widow and orphans were left to
suffer want, as well as to weep.

A scalp might originally be taken by the leader of the war party only
and at that period no other mutilation was practiced. It was a small
lock not more than three inches square, which was carried only during
the thirty days' celebration of a victory, and afterward given religious
burial. Wanton cruelties and the more barbarous customs of war were
greatly intensified with the coming of the white man, who brought
with him fiery liquor and deadly weapons, aroused the Indian's worst
passions, provoking in him revenge and cupidity, and even offered
bounties for the scalps of innocent men, women, and children.

Murder within the tribe was a grave offense, to be atoned for as the
council might decree, and it often happened that the slayer was called
upon to pay the penalty with his own life. He made no attempt to escape
or to evade justice. That the crime was committed in the depths of
the forest or at dead of night, witnessed by no human eye, made no
difference to his mind. He was thoroughly convinced that all is known to
the "Great Mystery," and hence did not hesitate to give himself up, to
stand his trial by the old and wise men of the victim's clan. His own
family and clan might by no means attempt to excuse or to defend him,
but his judges took all the known circumstances into consideration, and
if it appeared that he slew in self-defense, or that the provocation was
severe, he might be set free after a thirty days' period of mourning in
solitude. Otherwise the murdered man's next of kin were authorized to
take his life; and if they refrained from doing so, as often happened,
he remained an outcast from the clan. A willful murder was a rare
occurrence before the days of whiskey and drunken rows, for we were not
a violent or a quarrelsome people.

It is well remembered that Crow Dog, who killed the Sioux chief, Spotted
Tail, in 1881, calmly surrendered himself and was tried and convicted
by the courts in South Dakota. After his conviction, he was permitted
remarkable liberty in prison, such as perhaps no white man has ever
enjoyed when under sentence of death.

The cause of his act was a solemn commission received from his people,
nearly thirty years earlier, at the time that Spotted Tail usurped the
chieftainship by the aid of the military, whom he had aided. Crow Dog
was under a vow to slay the chief, in case he ever betrayed or disgraced
the name of the Brule Sioux. There is no doubt that he had committed
crimes both public and private, having been guilty of misuse of office
as well as of gross offenses against morality; therefore his death was
not a matter of personal vengeance but of just retribution.

A few days before Crow Dog was to be executed, he asked permission to
visit his home and say farewell to his wife and twin boys, then nine
or ten years old. Strange to say, the request was granted, and the
condemned man sent home under escort of the deputy sheriff, who remained
at the Indian agency, merely telling his prisoner to report there on
the following day. When he did not appear at the time set, the sheriff
dispatched the Indian police after him. They did not find him, and his
wife simply said that Crow Dog had desired to ride alone to the prison,
and would reach there on the day appointed. All doubt was removed next
day by a telegram from Rapid City, two hundred miles distant, saying:
"Crow Dog has just reported here."

The incident drew public attention to the Indian murderer, with the
unexpected result that the case was reopened, and Crow Dog acquitted.
He still lives, a well-preserved man of about seventy-five years, and is
much respected among his own people.

It is said that, in the very early days, lying was a capital offense
among us. Believing that the deliberate liar is capable of committing
any crime behind the screen of cowardly untruth and double-dealing, the
destroyer of mutual confidence was summarily put to death, that the evil
might go no further.

Even the worst enemies of the Indian, those who accuse him of treachery,
blood-thirstiness, cruelty, and lust, have not denied his courage, but
in their minds it is a courage that is ignorant, brutal, and fantastic.
His own conception of bravery makes of it a high moral virtue, for to
him it consists not so much in aggressive self-assertion as in absolute
self-control. The truly brave man, we contend, yields neither to fear
nor anger, desire nor agony; he is at all times master of himself; his
courage rises to the heights of chivalry, patriotism, and real heroism.

"Let neither cold, hunger, nor pain, nor the fear of them, neither the
bristling teeth of danger nor the very jaws of death itself, prevent you
from doing a good deed," said an old chief to a scout who was about to
seek the buffalo in midwinter for the relief of a starving people. This
was his childlike conception of courage.
